# Creating an RL Training App in an Nx Monorepo

This document outlines how to create an application for reinforcement learning (RL) training within an Nx monorepo. It assumes you have a data processing pipeline in place that converts text prompts to XML and then to JSON using XSD2JSON.

## Resources

*   **AWS RoboMaker (Deprecated):** AWS RoboMaker resource about training a robot using reinforcement learning ([https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/resources/train-a-robot-using-reinforcement-learning-project/](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/resources/train-a-robot-using-reinforcement-learning-project/)). Note that AWS RoboMaker is no longer available to new customers.
*   **Nx Tutorials:** Official Nx tutorials for creating monorepos with React and Angular ([https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial), [https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial)).

*   **Setting up Two Applications in an Nx Monorepo:** A Medium article demonstrating code sharing between applications in an Nx monorepo ([https://medium.com/@AmyScript/setting-up-two-applications-in-an-nx-monorepo-4bba3fccb01d](https://medium.com/@AmyScript/setting-up-two-applications-in-an-nx-monorepo-4bba3fccb01d)).
*   **Learning Nx:** A GitHub repository with basic Nx examples ([https://github.com/hchiam/learning-nx](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-nx)).
*   **Setting up a Monorepo with pnpm Workspaces and speed it up with Nx!:** A blog post on the Nx website about setting up a monorepo with pnpm workspaces and speeding it up with Nx ([https://nx.dev/blog/setup-a-monorepo-with-pnpm-workspaces-and-speed-it-up-with-nx](https://nx.dev/blog/setup-a-monorepo-with-pnpm-workspaces-and-speed-it-up-with-nx)).

## Steps

1.  **Set up your Nx workspace:**

    If you haven&apos;t already, create a new Nx workspace using the following command:

    ```bash
    pnpx create-nx-workspace@latest
    ```

    Choose a preset that is suitable for your project (e.g., &quot;react&quot;, &quot;angular&quot;, or &quot;node&quot;). This will generate the `apps` and `libs` directories.
2.  **Initialize a new pnpm workspace (if not using Nx Cloud):**

    If you are not using Nx Cloud, create a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file in the root of your monorepo with the following content:

    ```yaml
    packages:
      - &apos;apps/*&apos;
      - &apos;libs/*&apos;
    ```
3.  **Add Nx to a pnpm workspace (if necessary):**

    If you didn&apos;t select an Nx preset during workspace creation, install the `nx` package at the root level:

    ```bash
    pnpm add -w -D nx
    ```
4.  **Create a new Nx application:**

    Use the Nx CLI to generate a new application in your monorepo. When using React, Vite is a good choice for a development server. Choose a name that reflects the purpose of your RL application (e.g., `rl-training-app`).

    ```bash
    pnpx nx generate @nx/react:app rl-training-app --bundler=vite
    # or, for a Node.js application:
    pnpx nx generate @nx/node:app rl-training-app
    ```

    This command sets up the basic structure for your application within the `apps/rl-training-app` directory.
5.  **Create a library for data processing:**

    Create a library to encapsulate your data processing logic (txt to XML to JSON). This promotes code reusability and separation of concerns.

    ```bash
    pnpx nx generate @nx/node:library data-processing
    ```

    This command creates a library in the `libs/data-processing` directory.  Move your data processing code into the `libs/data-processing/src/lib` directory. This library should expose functions to:

    *   Convert txt prompt to XML
    *   Convert XML to JSON using XSD2JSON
    *   Load and prepare data for RL training

    Make sure to define a clear public API in the `index.ts` file of the library.
6.  **Install RL libraries:**

    Install the necessary RL libraries in your RL training application.  Navigate to your application directory first.

    ```bash
    cd apps/rl-training-app
    pnpm install tensorflow  # Or your preferred RL library
    # or
    pnpm install torch
    # or
    pnpm install ray
    ```

    Choose the library that best suits your needs and environment.  TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular choices for deep learning, while Ray provides a framework for distributed computing.
7.  **Implement RL training logic:**

    Implement the RL training logic in your application, defining the environment, agent, and training loop. Import the data processing library to load and prepare your data.

    ```typescript
    // Example (Conceptual - adjust based on your chosen RL framework)
    import { processData } from &apos;@your-org/data-processing&apos;;

    // ... your RL environment and agent setup ...

    const trainingData = processData(yourRawData);

    // ... your training loop using trainingData ...
    ```

    This step involves defining the core logic of your RL training process.  Consider using a modular design to separate the environment, agent, and training loop into distinct components.
8.  **Create a library for shared RL components (optional):**

    If you plan to reuse RL components across multiple applications or share them with other teams in your monorepo, creating a dedicated library is highly recommended. This promotes code sharing, reduces duplication, and ensures consistency across your projects.

    ```bash
    pnpx nx generate @nx/react:library rl-components --publishable --importPath=@your-org/rl-components
    # or
    pnpx nx generate @nx/node:library rl-components --publishable --importPath=@your-org/rl-components
    ```

    *   `--publishable`:  This flag indicates that the library is intended to be published and consumed by other projects (internal or external).
    *   `--importPath`:  This defines the import alias for the library (e.g., `@your-org/rl-components`), making it easier to import components in other projects.  Choose a unique and descriptive import path.

    Move the shared RL components into this library and export them from the library&apos;s `index.ts` file.  Examples of components that could be shared include:

    *   **Custom Neural Network Layers:** Reusable building blocks for your RL agents.
    *   **Activation Functions:**  Specialized activation functions tailored for RL tasks.
    *   **Environment Wrappers:**  Components that modify or augment the RL environment.
    *   **Reward Shaping Functions:**  Functions that define how rewards are calculated.
    *   **Data Preprocessing Utilities:**  Functions for preparing data for RL training.
    *   **Common Configuration Interfaces:**  Shared interfaces for configuring RL agents and environments.

    When creating shared components, consider the following:

    *   **Abstraction:** Design components to be as generic and reusable as possible.
    *   **Configuration:**  Use configuration options to customize the behavior of components.
    *   **Documentation:**  Provide clear and concise documentation for each component.
    *   **Testing:**  Write thorough unit tests to ensure the components function correctly.

9.  **Set up a training environment:**

    The training environment is a crucial part of your RL system. It simulates the world in which your agent will learn to interact. You have several options for setting up a training environment:

    *   **Simulation Environment:**  A simulated environment allows you to control various aspects of the training process and experiment with different scenarios. Popular simulation environments include:
        *   **OpenAI Gym:** A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a wide variety of environments, from classic control problems to Atari games.
        *   **Unity ML-Agents Toolkit:**  A Unity package that allows you to create and train intelligent agents in 3D environments.
        *   **DeepMind Lab:**  A 3D learning environment designed for agent-based AI research.
    *   **Real-World Environment:**  In some cases, you may want to train your agent in a real-world environment. This can be more challenging but can also lead to more robust and generalizable agents.
    *   **Custom Environment:** You can create your own custom environment using libraries like Pygame or other game development frameworks. This gives you complete control over the environment&apos;s dynamics and reward structure.

    When setting up your training environment, consider the following:

    *   **State Space:**  Define the set of possible states that the agent can observe.
    *   **Action Space:**  Define the set of possible actions that the agent can take.
    *   **Reward Function:**  Define the reward function that the agent will use to learn.  The reward function should incentivize the agent to achieve the desired goals.
    *   **Episode Termination Conditions:**  Define the conditions under which an episode will terminate (e.g., reaching a goal, running out of time, or failing to achieve a certain objective).

10. **Monitor and visualize training:**

    Monitoring and visualization are essential for understanding how your agent is learning and identifying potential problems. Implement tools to track key metrics during training, such as:

    *   **Episode Reward:**  The total reward received by the agent in each episode.
    *   **Average Reward:**  The average reward over a window of recent episodes.
    *   **Episode Length:**  The number of steps taken in each episode.
    *   **Loss Function:**  The value of the loss function used to train the agent&apos;s neural network.
    *   **Action Distribution:**  The distribution of actions taken by the agent.
    *   **State Distribution:**  The distribution of states visited by the agent.

    Popular tools for monitoring and visualizing RL training include:

    *   **TensorBoard:** A visualization toolkit for TensorFlow. It allows you to track metrics, visualize graphs, and inspect the weights and biases of your neural networks.
    *   **Weights &amp; Biases:** A platform for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments. It provides tools for experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, and model management.
    *   **MLflow:** An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging code, and deploying models.
    *   **Custom Dashboards:** You can create your own custom dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly. This gives you complete control over the visualization process.

    By carefully monitoring and visualizing your training process, you can gain valuable insights into your agent&apos;s behavior and identify areas for improvement.

11. **Configure caching:**

    Add an `nx.json` file to configure caching and task pipelines. This file allows you to define which tasks should be cached and how they depend on each other.

    ```json
    {
      &quot;tasksRunnerOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;default&quot;: {
          &quot;runner&quot;: &quot;nx/tasks-runners/default&quot;,
          &quot;options&quot;: {
            &quot;cacheableOperations&quot;: [&quot;build&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;lint&quot;, &quot;e2e&quot;],
            &quot;outputPath&quot;: &quot;dist/{project.root}&quot;
          }
        }
      },
      &quot;affected&quot;: {
        &quot;default&quot;: {
          &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;default&quot;]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This configuration enables caching for common tasks like `build`, `test`, `lint`, and `e2e`.  The `outputPath` specifies where the cached artifacts should be stored.  Refer to the Nx documentation for more advanced caching configurations.

12. **Properly use Nx commands:**

    Use `pnpx` to execute Nx commands within your pnpm workspace. Here are some common commands:

    *   `pnpx nx build rl-training-app`: Build the `rl-training-app` application.
    *   `pnpx nx test rl-training-app`: Test the `rl-training-app` application.
    *   `pnpx nx lint rl-training-app`: Lint the `rl-training-app` application.
    *   `pnpx nx build data-processing`: Build the `data-processing` library.
    *   `pnpx nx graph`: Visualize the project graph, showing dependencies between projects.
    *   `pnpx nx affected:test`: Test only the projects that have been affected by a code change.
    *   `pnpx nx run-many --target=build --all`: Build all projects in the workspace.

13. **Enforce module boundaries:**

    Use Nx&apos;s module boundary rules to enforce architectural constraints and prevent circular dependencies between your application and libraries. This helps maintain a clean and maintainable codebase. Configure these rules in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

14. **Leverage Nx&apos;s task caching:**

    Nx&apos;s task caching can significantly speed up your CI/CD pipeline. By caching task results, Nx avoids re-running tasks that have already been executed with the same inputs. This can dramatically reduce build times, especially in large monorepos.

15. **Test affected projects:**

    Use Nx&apos;s affected commands to run tests only on the projects that have been affected by a code change. This ensures that you&apos;re only testing the code that needs to be tested, saving time and resources.

    ```bash
    pnpx nx affected:test
    ```

    This command analyzes the changes in your codebase and runs tests only on the affected projects.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create a robust and scalable reinforcement learning training application within an Nx monorepo. Nx provides powerful tools for managing dependencies, caching tasks, and enforcing architectural constraints, making it an ideal choice for complex RL projects. Remember to consult the official Nx documentation for the most up-to-date information and best practices. Good luck!</file><file path=".cursor/nx-tool.md"># Nx Tool

## Approach

The integration process involves several key strategies:

*   **Leveraging Storybook Addons:** Utilize Storybook addons like `storybook-addon-code-editor` and `@storybook/addon-console` to simplify the integration of CodeMirror, provide a code editor, and enhance the development experience by displaying console outputs within Storybook.
*   **Component-Driven Development:** Build the chat interface and project generation tools as reusable Storybook components.
*   **Utilizing MDX for Documentation:** Employ MDX to create comprehensive and interactive documentation that combines code examples and explanatory text.
*   **Connecting to LLMs via API:** Implement an API client to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation and interactive assistance.
*   **Templating for Project Generation:** Use a templating engine to create projects from predefined templates, allowing for customization through user inputs.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Consider building a CLI to streamline project generation and other tasks.
*   **File System Management:** Use libraries like `fs-extra` for robust file system operations.

This approach ensures a modular, maintainable, and well-documented integration.

## Steps

1.  **Set up Storybook in your Nx monorepo:** Use Nx generators to add Storybook to your projects. This provides a structured environment for component development and documentation.
    *   Install the Nx Storybook plugin using **pnpm**:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev @nx/storybook
    ```
    *   Generate Storybook configuration for your project:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration project-name
    ```
    *   Launch Storybook for a specific project:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx run project-name:storybook
    ```

2.  **Integrate CodeMirror:** Incorporate CodeMirror into a Storybook component using `storybook-addon-code-editor` or a similar library. This will serve as the foundation for the chat interface and code editor.
    *   Install `storybook-addon-code-editor` as a dev dependency:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev storybook-addon-code-editor
    ```
    *   Update your `.storybook/main.ts` file to include the addon and configure the `staticDirs`:
    ```typescript:.storybook/main.ts
    // .storybook/main.ts
    import type { StorybookConfig } from &apos;@storybook/react-vite&apos;;
    import { getCodeEditorStaticDirs } from &apos;storybook-addon-code-editor/getStaticDirs&apos;;

    const config: StorybookConfig = {
      staticDirs: [...getCodeEditorStaticDirs(__filename)],
      addons: [&apos;storybook-addon-code-editor&apos;],
      framework: {
        name: &apos;@storybook/react-vite&apos;,
        options: {},
      },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

3.  **Connect to LLMs:** Implement the API connection to your chosen LLM within the CodeMirror-based chat component. This enables code generation and interactive assistance features.
    *   Use an API client like `axios` or `fetch` to communicate with the LLM.
    *   Example of sending a prompt to an LLM API:
    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch(&apos;https://api.llm.com/generate&apos;, {
      method: &apos;POST&apos;,
      headers: { &apos;Content-Type&apos;: &apos;application/json&apos; },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: &apos;Generate a React component&apos; }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

4.  **Implement Project Generation:** Create a mechanism to generate projects based on templates. This allows users to quickly create new projects with predefined structures and configurations.
    *   Use a templating engine like `handlebars` or `ejs` to generate files from templates.
    *   Example of generating a project structure:
    ```typescript
    import { copySync } from &apos;fs-extra&apos;;
    import { render } from &apos;handlebars&apos;;

    const template = `{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;{{projectName}}&quot;,
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;scripts&quot;: {
        &quot;start&quot;: &quot;nx serve {{projectName}}&quot;
      }
    }`;
    const rendered = render(template, { projectName: &apos;my-project&apos; });
    copySync(&apos;templates/project&apos;, &apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    ```

5.  **Develop a CLI (Optional):** Build a command-line interface using a library like `Commander.js` to automate project setup, code generation, and other development tasks.
    *   Example of a basic CLI setup:
    ```typescript
    import { Command } from &apos;commander&apos;;
    const program = new Command();

    program
      .command(&apos;generate &lt;projectName&gt;&apos;)
      .description(&apos;Generate a new project&apos;)
      .action((projectName) =&gt; {
        console.log(`Generating project: ${projectName}`);
        // Call project generation logic here
      });

    program.parse(process.argv);
    ```

6.  **Manage Files:** Use `fs-extra` to handle file system operations such as creating directories, copying files, and modifying file contents.
    *   Example of creating a directory and copying files:
    ```typescript
    import { ensureDirSync, copySync } from &apos;fs-extra&apos;;

    ensureDirSync(&apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    copySync(&apos;templates/project&apos;, &apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    ```

7.  **Integrate `@storybook/addon-console`:** Add the `@storybook/addon-console` to your Storybook to display console logs, warnings, and errors within the Storybook UI, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
    *   Install the addon:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev @storybook/addon-console @storybook/addon-actions
    ```
    *   Configure the addon in `.storybook/main.js`:
    ```javascript:.storybook/main.js
    export default {
      addons: [
        &quot;@storybook/addon-actions&quot;,
        &quot;@storybook/addon-console&quot;,
      ],
    };
    ```
    *   Use the `withConsole` decorator in `.storybook/preview.js`:
    ```javascript:.storybook/preview.js
    import type { Preview } from &apos;@storybook/react&apos;;
    import { withConsole } from &apos;@storybook/addon-console&apos;;

    const preview: Preview = {
      decorators: [(storyFn, context) =&gt; withConsole()(storyFn)(context)],
      // ...
    };
    ```

### Detailed Setup Instructions for CodeMirror and `storybook-addon-code-editor`
// ... existing code ...
### Integrating `@storybook/addon-console`

1.  **Installation:**

    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev @storybook/addon-console @storybook/addon-actions
    ```

2.  **Configuration:**

    *   Import the addon in your `.storybook/main.js` file:

    ```javascript:.storybook/main.js
    // .storybook/main.js
    export default {
      addons: [
        &quot;@storybook/addon-actions&quot;,
        &quot;@storybook/addon-console&quot;,
      ],
    };
    ```

3.  **Usage:**

    *   Optionally, use the `withConsole` decorator in your `preview.js` to associate console messages with specific stories:

    ```javascript:.storybook/preview.js
    // preview.js
    import type { Preview } from &apos;@storybook/react&apos;;
    import { withConsole } from &apos;@storybook/addon-console&apos;;

    const preview: Preview = {
      decorators: [(storyFn, context) =&gt; withConsole()(storyFn)(context)],
      // ...
    };
    ```

    *   You can customize the addon&apos;s behavior by passing options to `withConsole` or `setConsoleOptions`.

### Nx Monorepo Best Practices

*   **Centralized Component Library:** Consider creating a shared library within your Nx monorepo to house your components. This makes it easier to manage and reuse components across multiple projects.
*   **Storybook for Multiple Projects:** If you have multiple projects in your monorepo, you can set up Storybook for each project individually. Use the Nx Storybook plugin to generate configurations for each project.
*   **Caching and Task Optimization:** Leverage Nx&apos;s caching and task optimization features to speed up Storybook builds and development workflows. Use `nx affected:storybook` to only build and serve Storybook for projects that have changed.

This update provides a more comprehensive guide for integrating Storybook with CodeMirror in an Nx monorepo, making it more useful for developers using tools like Copilot and Cursor.</file><file path=".github/workflows/ci.yml">name: CI

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&amp;amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let&apos;s get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/ozqXSe9cod)


## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve dashboard
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build dashboard
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project dashboard
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &amp;raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

[Learn more about Nx release &amp;raquo;](hhttps://nx.dev/features/manage-releases?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Approach

The integration process involves several key strategies:

*   **Leveraging Storybook Addons:** Utilize Storybook addons like `storybook-addon-code-editor` and `@storybook/addon-console` to simplify the integration of CodeMirror, provide a code editor, and enhance the development experience by displaying console outputs within Storybook.
*   **Component-Driven Development:** Build the chat interface and project generation tools as reusable Storybook components.
*   **Utilizing MDX for Documentation:** Employ MDX to create comprehensive and interactive documentation that combines code examples and explanatory text.
*   **Connecting to LLMs via API:** Implement an API client to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation and interactive assistance.
*   **Templating for Project Generation:** Use a templating engine to create projects from predefined templates, allowing for customization through user inputs.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Consider building a CLI to streamline project generation and other tasks.
*   **File System Management:** Use libraries like `fs-extra` for robust file system operations.

This approach ensures a modular, maintainable, and well-documented integration.

## Steps

1.  **Set up Storybook in your Nx monorepo:** Use Nx generators to add Storybook to your projects. This provides a structured environment for component development and documentation.
    *   Install the Nx Storybook plugin using **pnpm**:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev @nx/storybook
    ```
    *   Generate Storybook configuration for your project:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration project-name
    ```
    *   Launch Storybook for a specific project:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx run project-name:storybook
    ```

2.  **Integrate CodeMirror:** Incorporate CodeMirror into a Storybook component using `storybook-addon-code-editor` or a similar library. This will serve as the foundation for the chat interface and code editor.
    *   Install `storybook-addon-code-editor` as a dev dependency:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev storybook-addon-code-editor
    ```
    *   Update your `.storybook/main.ts` file to include the addon and configure the `staticDirs`:
    ```typescript:.storybook/main.ts
    // .storybook/main.ts
    import type { StorybookConfig } from &apos;@storybook/react-vite&apos;;
    import { getCodeEditorStaticDirs } from &apos;storybook-addon-code-editor/getStaticDirs&apos;;

    const config: StorybookConfig = {
      staticDirs: [...getCodeEditorStaticDirs(__filename)],
      addons: [&apos;storybook-addon-code-editor&apos;],
      framework: {
        name: &apos;@storybook/react-vite&apos;,
        options: {},
      },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

3.  **Connect to LLMs:** Implement the API connection to your chosen LLM within the CodeMirror-based chat component. This enables code generation and interactive assistance features.
    *   Use an API client like `axios` or `fetch` to communicate with the LLM.
    *   Example of sending a prompt to an LLM API:
    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch(&apos;https://api.llm.com/generate&apos;, {
      method: &apos;POST&apos;,
      headers: { &apos;Content-Type&apos;: &apos;application/json&apos; },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: &apos;Generate a React component&apos; }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

4.  **Implement Project Generation:** Create a mechanism to generate projects based on templates. This allows users to quickly create new projects with predefined structures and configurations.
    *   Use a templating engine like `handlebars` or `ejs` to generate files from templates.
    *   Example of generating a project structure:
    ```typescript
    import { copySync } from &apos;fs-extra&apos;;
    import { render } from &apos;handlebars&apos;;

    const template = `{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;{{projectName}}&quot;,
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;scripts&quot;: {
        &quot;start&quot;: &quot;nx serve {{projectName}}&quot;
      }
    }`;
    const rendered = render(template, { projectName: &apos;my-project&apos; });
    copySync(&apos;templates/project&apos;, &apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    ```

5.  **Develop a CLI (Optional):** Build a command-line interface using a library like `Commander.js` to automate project setup, code generation, and other development tasks.
    *   Example of a basic CLI setup:
    ```typescript
    import { Command } from &apos;commander&apos;;
    const program = new Command();

    program
      .command(&apos;generate &lt;projectName&gt;&apos;)
      .description(&apos;Generate a new project&apos;)
      .action((projectName) =&gt; {
        console.log(`Generating project: ${projectName}`);
        // Call project generation logic here
      });

    program.parse(process.argv);
    ```

6.  **Manage Files:** Use `fs-extra` to handle file system operations such as creating directories, copying files, and modifying file contents.
    *   Example of creating a directory and copying files:
    ```typescript
    import { ensureDirSync, copySync } from &apos;fs-extra&apos;;

    ensureDirSync(&apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    copySync(&apos;templates/project&apos;, &apos;generated/my-project&apos;);
    ```

7.  **Integrate `@storybook/addon-console`:** Add the `@storybook/addon-console` to your Storybook to display console logs, warnings, and errors within the Storybook UI, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
    *   Install the addon:
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev @storybook/addon-console @storybook/addon-actions
    ```
    *   Configure the addon in `.storybook/main.js`:
    ```javascript:.storybook/main.js
    export default {
      addons: [
        &quot;@storybook/addon-actions&quot;,
        &quot;@storybook/addon-console&quot;,
      ],
    };
    ```
    *   Use the `withConsole` decorator in `.storybook/preview.js`:
    ```javascript:.storybook/preview.js
    import type { Preview } from &apos;@storybook/react&apos;;
    import { withConsole } from &apos;@storybook/addon-console&apos;;

    const preview: Preview = {
      decorators: [(storyFn, context) =&gt; withConsole()(storyFn)(context)],
      // ...
    };
    ```
